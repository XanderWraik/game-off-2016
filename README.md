# GitHub Game Off 2016

BattleSim is more of a simulator and less of a game. 
It allows the player only to spectate an ongoing batte between two teams.
BattleSim tries to remodel sword fighting in a game involving bots.

The core logic of each AI Bot is written in pure C++ instead of Blueprints with only some function calls being implemented in Blueprints. 

BattleSim is created in Unreal Engine 4.0.14. 
Download the files and generate the project files using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

This is only the start fo BattleSim. 
Stay tuned for more!!
